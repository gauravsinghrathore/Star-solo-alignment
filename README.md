# Star-solo-alignment using CellRanger .bam files

This GitHub commit introduces the Star-solo-alignment method as a solution to the issue of Velocyto CLI's inability to detect key genes during count matrix creation. The purpose of this repository is to reuse previously processed 10X count matrix information to generate a new count matrix that includes spliced and unspliced gene information from Star Solo. The workflow is divided into two parts: using the command line to map 10X .bam files with the reference genome to build count matrices, and using a Jupyter notebook to create an adata object that matches the cells and metadata from pre-analyzed count matrices from CellRanger count.
